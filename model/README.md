* `model.py` contains the logic of the model simulations
* `modelUtils.py` and `analysis.py`, contain utility functions for pulling out model data and processing 
  * e.g. logic for computing accuracy
* `gs0317.py` contains the logic for the gridsearch
* `make_gsdf.py` is a big messy loop that condenses all the files generated form the gridsearch into one big dataframe for analysis
